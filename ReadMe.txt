### Other:
From this version onward, full source code (*.cpp) is no longer released, only partial header files (*.h).  
This is due to violations of the open-source license by some users.  
Those who understand the principles will still be able to comprehend the implementation from the headers alone, rather than rebranding this project as paid software.
